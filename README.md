## About the project

There are a lot of quotation websites.
But how to guarantee who wrote the sentences?
How to make sure we are giving proper credits?

This is what Quack Quotes aims to fix. Curated quotes.
Quack Quotes values quality over quantity.

This project is part of a volunteer project I manage for Brazilian students, [Quack RedaÃ§Ã£o](https://quackredacao.com.br/about-us/). It was born in 2016 and we help students to get bet on writing essays.

## Colaborations

This is the first project I am starting to build and share in public. May the gods bless me. Opinions and help are welcome, but take in mind I am a designer, and still kinda newbie in the development field. :P

I not even know how issues work, how someone contribute to Github and nothing else. By the way, if you want to reach me, I'll be glad to learn...

My life resumes to "git add .", "git commit" and "git push".

Update: I recently kind of learned what issues are meant for... haha ðŸ™Š
